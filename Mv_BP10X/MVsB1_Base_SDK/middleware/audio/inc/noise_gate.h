/**
 * @brief Initialize noise gate module
 * @param ct Pointer to a NoiseGateCT object.
 * @param num_channels Number of channels. Set 1 for mono signals and 2 for stereo signals.
 * @param sample_rate Sample rate.
 * @param lower_threshold The threshold (in dB) below which the gate will close. Allowable range: -90dB ~ 0dB.
 * @param upper_threshold The threshold (in dB) above which the gate will open. This value should be greater or equal to lower_threshold. Allowable range: -90dB ~ 0dB.
 * @param attack_time The length of time (in millisecond) the gate takes to change from closed to fully open. It is the fade-in duration.
 * @param release_time The length of time (in millisecond) the gate takes to change from open to fully closed. It is the fade-out duration. A fast release abruptly cuts off the sound, whereas a slower release smoothly attenuates the signal from open to closed, resulting in a slow fade-out. If the release time is too short a click can be heard when the gate re-opens.
 * @param hold_time The length of time (in millisecond) the gate will stay fully open after the signal falls below lower_threshold, and before the Release period is commenced. The hold control is often set to ensure the gate does not close during short pauses between words or sentences in a speech signal.
 * @return error code. NG_ERROR_OK means successful, other codes indicate error.
