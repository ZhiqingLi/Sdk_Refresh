    This demo is based on the GD32E230C-EVAL-V1.0 board, it shows how to configure the
  comparator trigger timer 2 channel 0 input capture event, which is configured 
  to generate an interrupt on both rising and falling edge of the output signal.
  In this demo, input 3.3V to CMP0_IP. After system start-up, enable comparator 
  and trigger interrupt,then LED3 is on.  

    Connect PA1 to +3V3.
