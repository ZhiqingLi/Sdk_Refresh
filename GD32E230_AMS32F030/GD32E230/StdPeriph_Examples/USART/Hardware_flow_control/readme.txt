  This example is based on the GD32E230C-EVAL-V1.0 board, it provides a basic communication
between USART0 and the hyperterminal. 

  After system start-up, the txbuffer is sent by USART0, the hyperterminal will receive
the data of txbuffer. Then a string end by '\r' is sent from the hyperterminal. If USART0
receives the data, it will send the received data to the hyperterminal. The hyperterminal
should open RTS and CTS function.
