  This demo is based on the GD32E230C-EVAL-V1.0 board, it shows how to configure the 
TIMER peripheral to generate the toggle signal.
  
  The TIMxCLK frequency is set to systemcoreclock, the prescaler is 3600, so the 
TIMER2 counter clock is 20KHz.
  
  TIMER2 configuration: CH1 output compare toggle mode:
CH1 update rate = TIMER2 counter clock / CH1CV = 20000/4000 = 5 Hz. 

  Connect the TIMER2 CH1(PA7) to an oscilloscope to monitor waveform.
