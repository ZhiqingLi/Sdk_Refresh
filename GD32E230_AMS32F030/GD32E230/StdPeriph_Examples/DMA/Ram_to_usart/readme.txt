  This example is based on the GD32E230C-EVAL-V1.0 board, it provides a description of 
how to use DMA channel 3 to transfer data from RAM memory to USART transmit data 
register.The start of transfer is triggered by software. At the end of the transfer, 
a transfer complete interrupt is generated since it is enabled. If the data stored 
array welcome[] is transferred correctly by DMA, the string will be displayed on a 
serial port tool by USART and LED2 lights up.
